How to run Prototype:
Please double click the index.html file located in the folder. You may need to zoom out to get a full view of the prototype depending on your monitor resolution. (ctrl+mousewheel)

What the Prototype can do:
Our prototype can demystify the current incarnation of SIS by allowing a more intuitive user experience. We accomplish this by emulating the my.umflint.edu page to keep styles concise and consistent across UM-Flint services.

What the Prototype can't do:
The Prototype is unable to lead to websites outside of the domain of SIS (such as the campus map) and does not account for tasks that are not inside of our scope of "frequently used" tasks (such as admissions and housing). The search function in the class catalog section is also unable to be used as that would require a queryable database. 

Task Instructions:
1. From the Main Menu, please find the appropriate page to change your password
2. Find the Housing and Residential Life page
3. Search for a computer science class with your favorite instructor or Dr. Mani between 3 and 5 PM
4. Find where to view student transcripts
5. Find where to view graduation applications
6. View the current years scholarship application
7. Find where to register for orientation
8. Find where you would setup guest access to view student information and add a user
9. Find the campus map
10. Logout of SIS
